To run the project:

1. Download release from https://sourceforge.net/projects/rest-news/files/ (I can't upload executables to GitHub).
2. Extract archive into folder. It should be a .jar file and WebContent folder with frontend files.
3. Run .jar file through command line (cmd) using command (  java -jar rest-news-v1.jar  ). It should start on localhost on port 8080. 
4. Open WebContent folder and run index.html file. The app should be working fine now. If you want to use another port or it didn't start on port 8080, just change apiRoot variable in script.js file to appropriate port showed in command line after executing jar file.

If there are any problems feel free to contact me.
